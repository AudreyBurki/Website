# Research in the Cognitive Science: Language & Methods Lab

We study the cognitive architecture of the language production and comprehension systems using a variety of methods and measurements: response times, eye-tracking, EEG, corpus data. 

We have a dedicated interest in applied statistics, and apply state-of-the-art methods to our studies.
