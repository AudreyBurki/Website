# Research in the Cognitive Science: Language & Methods Lab

We study the cognitive architecture of the language production and comprehension systems using a variety of methods and measurements: response times, eye-tracking, EEG, corpus data. 

We have a dedicated interest in applied statistics (machine learning, bayesian models, linear mixed-effects models, etc.) and attach great importance to open science practices. We do our best to use available tools, inculding pre-registration, power-analyses, sharing of data and code.
